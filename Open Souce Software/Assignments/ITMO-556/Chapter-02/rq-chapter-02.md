# Review Questions and Answers - Chapter 2

## 1. Based on the movie’s tone and rhetoric - why do you think there was an anti-Microsoft tone at the time of the movies making (~2001)? (You may need to research Microsoft anti-trust case). 
US government had accused Microsoft of illegally maintaining its monopoly position in the PC market primarily through legal and technical restrictions it put on the abilities of PC manufacturers and users to uninstall IE and use other programs such as Netscape and Java.
Microsoft bundled its flagship IE web browser software with it’s Windows operating system. So like this every Windows user had an IE copy so this restricted the market of other competing web browsers like Netscape, Opera since it typically took time to download or purchase such software at store.  
For this accusation Microsoft stated that merging of IE and Windows was a result of innovation and competition, that the two were now the same product and inextricably linked and consumers were receiving the benefits of IE for free. 
Opponents countered that IE was still a separate product which did not need to be tied up to Windows since a separate version of IE was available for MacOS. 
So, Microsoft was accused for its monopolization in the PC market. 

## 2. When Bill Gates wrote his 1976 “Open Letter to Hobbyists”, was he justified in his complaint? Why or why not? 
Millions of people have illegal copies of Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office. Some of these come from casual copying between friends, others are downloaded with peer to peer file sharing systems.
Bill Gates’s campaign against piracy began in 1976, when he published his Open Letter to Hobbyists, which accused those who were using Microsoft’s Altair BASIC without paying the license fee of stealing the software.
I consider four arguments against copying that Microsoft has put forward: first that software piracy is theft; second that software piracy violates the rights of copyright holders; third that software piracy is free riding; and fourth that software piracy reduces incentives to future innovation.
I argue that the first argument is simply wrong, and the other three do not establish that it is in fact wrong to copy Microsoft's programs. 
I conclude that software piracy is wrong only when it prevents a company from recovering their costs and receiving a reasonable rate of profit on their investment; and given that Microsoft has already received a more than reasonable profit on all the works that people are pirating, copying them for free is not wrong.
But the claim that the hobbyists were stealing Microsoft’s program is unconvincing.
There was no physical reason why all the users of the Altair 8800 could not use Microsoft’s BASIC: the program was not degraded or worn out as more people copied it. So it is not true to describe what the hobbyists were doing as theft: theft deprives the owner of the use of the object whilst what the hobbyists were doing did not. Whatever is wrong with copyright piracy, it is something different from what is wrong with theft.
The article makes the following claims:
1. Software piracy is wrong only when prevents the copyright holder from receiving a fair return to their efforts. It is not true to claim that a copyright holder is wronged whenever someone copies their work without paying the license fee.

2. We should understand a fair return on the copyright holder's efforts to imply no more than that they should be able to recover their costs and receive a reasonable rate of profit on one's investment.

3. Microsoft has now received more than its costs plus more than a reasonable rate of profit from Microsoft Office and from Microsoft Windows.

4. Therefore it is not wrong to copy this software without paying.

## 3. Would Richard Stallman enter into a discussion on which is a better product: Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer? Why or why not? Would Eric S. Raymond enter into a discussion on which is a better product: Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer? Why or why not? 
Both Richard Stallman and Eric S Raymond would prefere to talk in favor of LibreOffice Writer as it is a free and open-source word processor component of the LibreOffice software package and is a fork of OpenOffice.org Writer. Writer is a word processor similar to Microsoft Word and Corel's WordPerfect with many similar features, and file format compatibility.Writer can be used across a variety of platforms, including Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows and is licensed under Mozilla Public License and secondary license GPL to which Richard Stallman will always support. Whereas Microsoft Word is a word processor  developed by Microsoft and licensed under Trialware which is a proprietary software.

## 4. Why did Bruce Perens help write the Open Source Definition / Debian Social Contract Standard? 
Some people in the free software camp were little scared back then by the commercialization. Commercialization is very important, and they wanted to mainstream this software and then Bruce Perens worked with Richard Stallman and wrote Open Source Definition. He wrote the original draft after discussing it for a month with Debian developers and made it their project policy and then he decided to relabel what he had written for Debian as the __open source definition__. 

Open Source Definition Rights
1.	Free Redistribution
2.	Source Code available
3.	Derived Works permitted
4.	Integrity of the Author’s source code
5.	No Discrimination against persons or groups
6.	No Discrimination against Fields of Endeavor
7.	Distribution of License
8.	License must not be specific to a product
9.	License must not contaminate other software

## 5. What were the two commercial Linux companies featured in the movie (Note-one does not exist any longer)? 
RedHat and VA linux

## 6. What is Red Hat Linux’s stock price today compared to the the price listed in the movie? What is VA Linux’s stock price today compared to the movie? (Hint VA Linux was sold and now belongs to another company, find that company’s stock price.) 
Red Hat: Red Hat acquired by IBM so IBM’s stock price which is __131.17 USD__
VA Linux: GameStop finally acquired Geeknet Inc. (the new name of VA Linux) for $140 million on June 2, 2015 – Stock price today - __3.70 USD__

## 7. According to Eric S. Raymond what was the major application that needed to “flip” for opensource to become a viable enterprise solution? 
According to Eric the next moment what he thought was pivotal when the database members flipped over from Oracle and other key database members. In order for open source story to be credible or Linux story to be credible they had to get commitments from independent software vendors to do ports of their applications to these platforms. That was the major application that needed to flip for open source to become a viable enterprise solution.  
	
## 8. What was the first major commercial company to opensource a key product? What did that product eventually become? 
Oracle was the first major commercial company to opensource a key product Oracle Database.
	
## 9. How does Richard Stallman react at the end of the movie to the success of the Linux kernel to the exclusion of the GNU toolchain? 
Richard Stallman says that 15 years ago, if you wanted to use computer the only way you could do is with proprietary software. A lot of people didn’t like it. Some of us were determined to make an alternative to develop a free software operating system that will give users the chance to have freedom while they use their computers. He knew that they would eventually get the Kernel done. Before they could, somebody did a better Kernel. In the old days we had an overall strategy calling people’s attention to the importance of freedom. The only workable way to try change it was making that strategy work again is to spread the word the Operating System you are using is the GNU system. Someone modified of course and people will look at the reasons which developed the system, they will think about the issues and some of them will agree. He asks people to tell it is a GNU system. It is a combination of GNU and Linux so we can call it GNU/Linux. Whole GNU project is one big hack its one big act of sub receive play for cleverness to change society for the better because He is only interested in changing for the better but in a clever way.

## 10. What is the main difference between “Free Software” and “Open Source Software”?	
Although there are different rules for free software licenses (four freedoms) and open source licenses (Open Source Definition), what is not apparent from those two sets of rules is:
1.	Both terms refer to essentially the same set of licenses and software, and

2.	Each term implies different underlying values.

The concept of "free software" was developed by Richard Stallman in the 1980s. The focus is on what the recipient of software is permitted to do with the software: "Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the software."
Open source is a development methodology or a business issue; free software is a social movement or a moral issue."
