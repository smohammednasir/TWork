# Podcast Questions and Answers - Chapter 2

## 7:21 Who is Vicky Brasseur and what does she do? 
Vicky Brasseur used to run Software engineering dept at the VP director level, But she gave up her big corporate job and does freelancing for companies to help them sustainably use, contribute to release and comply with free and opensource projects. She makes money from open source. She has been in the industry for about 20 years and using free and opensource software for approximately 30 or so.

## 8:45 What has changed the most in regard to the term OpenSource in the last 25+ years?
Back in the day when one would say opensource, someone would have no idea what one was was talking about. They would have assumed Free software like they don’t have to pay for it. It’s free. We all know that obviously is not the case and we also now in the situation where we don’t have to explain quite this much anymore. Opensource software has become the default for so many things. If you are going to develop something, you are going to start with opensource pace. You might then keep it internally and keep it proprietary, but you are going to start with open source, with opensource programming language, opensource libraries, opensource operating system most likely so, its just become the way that we do business. 

## 10:00 What is assumed to now be the default development pattern for new software? 
Now it is more than default. It is going to start with opensource. If you want a website, you can start with apache. You are not going to buy stuff from somebody else to do that. Transition is happening and this transition happening over the years that people are going in the opensource where instead of saying we have a proprietary product there are many companies saying we are all opensource top to bottom. We put everything out there, developer work in github.  

## 13:00 According to Randall, when a company publishes its code as OpenSource, what do they gain?
By publishing your entire source code, you no longer have just resources that you can pay a salary to but also have the resources that anybody’s that is interested in that software as well and until the manager whoever controls that understands principle of leveraging. It’s a no deal. Why would one give intellectual secrets to the public, but that also requires being dedicated to developing community in other words keeping your bug list public keeping your repository in git hub rather than keeping a separate repository. 
   
## 15:57 What do companies struggle with when they decide to opensource their codebase and coreproducts and how do they solve it? 
People __releasing their secret SAAS__ without figuring out a business model first has not worked so far as it is a very poor advice. Companies push a lot of open code which is great but if you don’t have that business model you haven’t figured out yet how you are going to make money. For that do not release the code yet. Figure that out first as it has nothing to do with free and open source software and has everything to do with learning how to run a business. Just get that nailed, figure that out and then the free and opensource software becomes the tool that you use to help make a profitable business. It is not the reason to go into the business to release free and opensource software. Nobody is going to make money just on that. One must learn how to run a business which means one has to do user study, market research, make sure that there actually is a market for the product you are trying to do. What is the product that you are going to be selling support? Why will people buy support when they can just use a product. One must figure that out before releasing the secret SAAS. That is a very poor business. 

## 19:00 What are some of the OpenSource companies? 
HortonWorks, Mongo DB, Redhat.

## 19:35 What are the majority of OpenSource companies strategies to make money? 
Their business model is to just get acquired. That is going to the exit. 

## 22:40 What do companies need to figure out about Free and OpenSource? 
If fundamental foundation of a company's culture is free and opensource software, then as a company you have the responsibility to teach people about that. You can’t assume that just going to pick it up. This should become not only part of on boarding and a very large part of on boarding, but it should be reinforced for everyone across the entire organization equally. Make sure everyone understands not only why it is important to the company and figure out why free and opensource software is important for this company. What is free and opensource software is? Lot of companies don’t know the history they don’t know about licensing. Giving people foundation of knowledge on which, they can then build.  

## 24:25 What is the term “Yak-Shaving” mean? 
Yak-Shaving – is all of the crap you need to do before you can actually get back to the one thing you are trying to accomplish, and we do this all the time in software development. For eg. Let’s say you really need to fix a chair in dining room, first you have to clear off the work bench before that u have to empty out the garage because there is no space for it on your workbench. Before u empty out the garage you have to get rid of the yak sitting in your driveway which you have to shave it. You must shave the yak which is sitting in your driveway. 

## 27:25 Who is Vicky’s new book targeting? 
__Forge your future with open source__ – useful for developers. Specifically goes out of its way to make sure its inclusive of all of the roles necessary for free and open source software development. So, designers, translators and security folks and documentarians who are necessary to make free and open source software project or any software project successful. This will help to raise quality of free and open source software.   

## 28:03 What is the book about? 
It is about how to contribute to free and opensource software. Its kind of the not to violate somebody's copyright but its unwritten missing manual for how to contribute to free and open source software. Everything from how to interact with the mailing list to how to find a project. There is section in about how to contribute projects if you don’t know how to code or even if you know how to code, you are hired and you still want to contribute. It is 200 pages long. 

## 33:25 What is the mistaken impression about contributing to OpenSource Software? 
The only mistaken impression about opensource software was that people thought that if they don’t know how to code cannot help or contribute to the free and open source software but even filing a bug helps or a feature request or writing some documentation or translation or writing up tutorials these are all the ways people can help.

## 37:40 What do you need to read before contributing to an OpenSource project?
Read the contributing guide if you have. If you don’t have a contributing guide find it on the project.

## 43:00 What does Vicky believe is important for a project to have and to enforce for a community? 
Course of conduct is very important. But even more important is enforcing the course of conduct. One must take time to learn how to welcome people, how to deal with negative situation when they come up and how to deal in an empathetic way.

## 48:01 What is the myth about users of proprietary operating systems (Windows and MacOS)? 
Users of Windows and MacOS or proprietary operating system have a myth that the free and opensource operating systems are your choice. They don’t believe in opensource software even though there’s a plethora of open source software is available.

## 49:00 Vicky used Linux for 10 years, what drove her away from it?
Vicky was spending too much time working on opensource and trying to make it kind of beating it into submission so that she could get her work done. It was very tiring. She did not have time for that. She says that If she must make free and open source software better, she needs to get that out of her way. Just streamline her workflow and she does that with Mac. And she noticed that people are not using Linux and are not using free software.
