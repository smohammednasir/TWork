# Lab - Chapter 12

### 1) Using two virtual machines, while powered off, in the VirtualBox settings, enable a second network interface and set the type to host-only (details are in last chapter and the VirtualBox networking details are in chapter 03).
a. You will be modifying the IP address of both of these systems: 192.168.33.10 and 192.168.33.11, netmask is 255.255.255.0 and gateway should be 10.0.2.2 (this is due to VirtualBox).

b. Configure these settings in Network Manager for the respective Virtual Machines.

c. Capture a screen shot of each system using the ping tool to ping the other IP and its results.

d. Modify the /etc/hosts file and add an entry for both system in both systems
e. Execute the ping command again this time using the hostname declared in the /etc/hosts file.

### 2) Repeat the above exercise but deactivate NetworkManager in systemctl and activate systemdnetworkd (CentOS)
a. In addition, on Ubuntu modify the Netplan conf to use networkd and place your YAML configuration there.

###3) Using firewalld open port 22 permanently to allow SSH connections to your Fedora or Centos system.

### 4) Using firewalld open port 80 permanently to allow SSH connections to your Fedora or Centos system.

### 5) Enable the firewall to start at boot and show its status after a successful boot.

### 6) Install and enable firewalld on Ubuntu, deactivate UFW if it is running.

### 7) Create a self-singed SSL certificate

### 8) Create a sample PHP webpage that displays phpinfo() at https://localhost/index.php. Name the file info.php and push it to your GitHub repo
a. Make sure you have installed all the pre-reqs (Apache2 and PHP)
   ![Lab 1a](/Images/Chapter-12/lab8.PNG)

### 9) Enable the Apache Webserver and the proper firewall port to serve you phpinfo page over https.

### 10) Going to Wordpress.org and download the latest tar.gz file. Follow the 5 minute setup to configure a working Wordpress blog.

### 11) Repeat the install process above, this time using two servers, with static IP addresses configured, placing the MySQL database on a separate IP address â€“ configuring Wordpress properly and installing all needed pre-reqs.
a. Make sure to open the proper firewall ports and note that the first server will be the webserver and requires the apache2, php, php-mysql, and the php-client library only.
b. The second database server requires the Mysql-server package. Make one to be Ubuntu one to be Fedora/CentOS.

### 12) Install the Ghost Blogging Platform on a single OS of your choice.
a. Install nodejs, nginx, and mysql prerequisites
b. Create a directory in your home directory called ghost-files. Execute the install tutorial in the next step in that directory.
c. Follow the install instructions at Ghost.org to install the Ghost blogging platform.

### 13) Create a fresh Ubuntu Virtual Machine and create a shell script that will automate the installation of the following and their dependencies:
a. Install and Active Firewalld, open ports 22, 80, 443
b. Download and install latest Wordpress tarball (look at using sed -i to do an inplace substitution of the default values in the wordpress config file)
c. Firewall to only allow single IP connection for SSH and port 80 and 443 (that IP being a second virtual machine with a static IP assigned)
d. Modify /etc/hosts to include these entries and take a screenshot of the output of your firewall status as well as you accessing the Wordpress blog via the browser using the hostname configured in /etc/hosts on the remote machine.
