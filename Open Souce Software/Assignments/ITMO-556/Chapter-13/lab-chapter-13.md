# Lab - Chapter 13

### Part 1
Create a folder structure for 1 Ubuntu Bionic64 vagrant box and 1 Centos 7 vagrant box. In each of these folders use the vagrant init command to create a Vagrantfile. Upon succesfully executing the vagrant up command in both directories, take a screenshot of the output of the vagrant box list command.

### Part 2
Run the packer json build templates for Centos 7 and Ubuntu 18.04 from the textbook source code located in files > Chapter 13 > packer-build-tempates, for each template execute packer build centos-7-vanilla-json and packer build ubuntu18041-vanilla.json. Once these Vagrant boxes are built, use the vagrant box add command to add them to your Vagrant system. Run the vagrant init command with the proper options to create a Vagrantfile and then run the vagrant up command to instantiate the box. Issue the command vagrant ssh and once logged in take a screenshot of the output of the command free --giga to list the amount of memory in the virtual machine. Upon completion take a screenshot of the output of the vagrant box list command to show that these steps completed successfully.

### Part 3
Edit the Vagrantfile for both Vagrant boxes to run at 3072 RAM (3 GB) each. Issue the command to reload and re-provision the virtual machines. Upon successfully issuing this command, issue the vagrant ssh command and again execute the free --giga command to show that the memory adjustment actually took place. Take a screenshot of the results.

### Part 4
Utilize the vagrant destroy command. On each of the four Vagrant boxes that have been created in the previous steps, execute the command to install the Apache2 webserver:
• sudo apt-get install apache2
• sudo yum install httpd
Take a screenshot of the output of the sudo systemctl status apache2 or sudo systemctl status httpd command. Exit the Vagrant box. Issue a vagrant destroy command, then a vagrant up command. Issue the vagrant ssh command and reissue the above systemctl commands to show that all 4 boxes have been destroyed and rebuilt. Take a screenshot of the results.
