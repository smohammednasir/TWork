Podcast Answers: Centos - http://twit.tv/floss/142


### ~2:25 Why did Randal’s previous employer have a large (1000s) Red Hat system deployed?
They won't to be able to call someone up in the middle of the night and say 'Something is broken and needs to be fixed.' and they pay large amount of money for that. RHEL is really good for large organizations and what CentOs does is take sources that Redhat has to make available to community and they compile them and support them.

### ~3:40 What is the short story about how Centos came about?
Few years back Redhat decided to change their enterprise Linux strategy and brought in a subscription model for the product they were going to support. They left the sources of that product available to public. CentOs take these sources and build a distribution with the sources to be as close to the Redhat offering as possible as binary compatible as AVI compliant as aPI compliant with the only diffrence being things look different and there is no support provided. It is a Linux distribution built on the sources provided by RedHat Linux and is completly binary compatible with RHEL. 

### ~4:58 Who is the largest commercial Enterprise Linux?
RedHat

### ~7:17 How do the two projects relate to each other? How do they relate to each other from the RedHat point of view?
From CentOs end they seem to have a good relation with RedHat. RedHat engineering and RedHat technical are quite happy with what Centos is doing whereas Redhat marketing and sales are not really happy with Centos.

### ~8:10 Who from RedHat is not happy with Centos?
Redhat marketing and sales are not really happy with CentOs.

### ~10:25 How do Centos users differ from RedHat’s paying customers?
When RedHat went down the root of creating the RHEL product base they went in subscription model and with the subscription model got a product which they will support. If there is anything a user wanted to do on that platform which chaged the product for eg. use a different kernel and run it in an environmentthat RedHat does not officially endorse or use hardware against that machine which is not gratified by RedHat. There would be a lot of support issues and RedHat would not be very keen on supporting whose platforms which is the reason centos got together to create a platform so that people could sort off figuratively shoot themselves using whatever instrument they want. There is no support no guarantee is a best effort.

### ~19:00. How does the RHEL environment work vs Fedora environment? (RedHat Enterprise Linux)
RHEL focusses on having a product that is sustainable over a period of time. For eg. if you install a blog in your website in 2007 you don't want to be in a situation where every six months you are reinstalling your machine and going to do the whole thing again and again and that is how fedora works. Whereas RHEL and Centos you install a machine in 2007 and you get 7-8 years of continuous bug fix and security support without any problem and issues.   

### ~22:55 Since Centos is using the RHEL code base how long does Centos lag behind the RHEL codebase when a new release is issued?
A day or a day and a half that is within 24 hours. For major releases they take few weeks.

### ~24:24 How does Centos make money?
Centos doesn't make money.

### ~29:00 How does Centos pay for everything?
By donations.

### ~30:00 Who was Lance Davis and what happened with him?
Lance Davis was one of the first guys to get involved with centos project. He took on the role of administrating the project. Everything was going well for few years and later he did not have time and resources to contribute back to the project due to personal commitements.  

### ~35:00 Kiran mentioned 2 million users for Centos - what did they do right compared to other projects (whitebox linux) that didn’t make it?
Focus was the key. What they were creating they knew what they were doing. They focussed on binary compatibility with RedHat platform which allowed users to inherit a lot of the work that Redhat was doing and contributing to the open source world. Also focussed on educating users. 

### ~44:00 Is Centos for Servers only or can you use it on the Desktop?
Though Centos is widely used for server applications, it can be used on the Desktop.

### Personal questions - is what Centos doing legal? Is it ethical/moral? Why or why not?
Yes. It is legal. Basically anyone has the right to redisteribute the software that is Linux but cannot use RedHat name or logo with their distro. Which is why CentOs has removed and replaced it with their Logos and name which seems to be fine and ethical.
