### ~13:30 What is the relationship between Fedora and Redhat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)?
Every few years Redhat will take the code in fedora, snapshot it and take a look of what is inside and make a lot of changes and heavy duty quality assurance and huge amount of hardware testing, independent hardware and software vendor certification and all of this goes into a process of about 6 months to a year and make the enterprise product that is RHEL.

RHEL - a lot of hardware and software certification is done for each release which is not in case of CentOs product.
