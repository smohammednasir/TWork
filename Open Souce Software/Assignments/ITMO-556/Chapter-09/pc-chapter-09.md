### Podcast Answers: - NodeJS - https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly/episodes/387

### ~4:20 Where does Aaron (guy wearing black) say he is starting to see Node JS more and more?
Aaron says there is a node platform, the drag and drop quick contructor kind of thing which you can get on the Raspberry Pi. From a makers perspective he is getting interested in nodeJS more and more like how it is been used as people are creatring new devices.

### ~7:22 What is Node.js?
Node is a javascript platform, One can do pretty much anything with it. It started in 2009. The whole idea behind it was that JavaScript did not really have a platform to run on computer environments, also was a good fit for non blocking IO as there was no threading model inside JS. Node is kind of a thing which is bringing JavaScripteverywhere. It is an open source, cross platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.

### ~8:50 Accroding to Mikael, what are we seeing an explosion of?
Explosion of fullstack. All the different computer environments pulled altogether. 

### ~9:15 What language(s) is NodeJS similar to?
Python, Go, Ruby.

### ~9:35 What is Event Driven Programming?
Event based, which happens on click of something an event handler handles the functions which is why it is called as event driven programming.

### ~10:45 what is NodeJS package manager/ecosystem?
NPM

### ~12:05 what kind of things would use Node?
It is not just seen in higher power devices but now on lower power devices as well. The way front-end development is done has changed dramatically in last few years and a lot of that is because of Node. Node has now created a platform for peopl to build really advancecompiler toolchains, like cross compiling down from the newer languages and adding features of the language.

### ~17:20 What are the two popular desktop apps built in NodeJS that Mikael mentioned?
Slack and Visual studio Code.

### ~ 19:30 What are some of the ways to learn NodeJS?
There are many online courses available. One can choose whichever they are comfortable with. They have great documentation. If you google about node you can find good stackoverflow. Also there is an amazing community called Node school that has created a bunch of interactive self starter courses.

### ~ 21:30 What did Microsoft do with NodeJS and where did it get Node?
Microsoft put node on shocker engine which got node in XBox, Windows10 IOT and windows phones all because they are running on shocker there.

### ~ 22:30 Mikael mentions multiple languages: TypeScript, CoffeeScript, Electron, and Dart – what are they and how do they relate to the NodeJS project? (Need to do some side research)
Typescript, CoffeeScript, Electron and Dart are all higher level languages. All of these work in node and those compilers are written in Node. Visual studio code was built in trypescript. TypeScript is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language wheras CoffeeScript adds syntactic sugar inspired by Ruby, Python and Haskell and Electron combines the Chromium rendering engine and the Node.js runtime. All of these has nodeJS runtime as these laguages compiles to Javascript.

### ~25:27 What company started the NodeJS and eventually the NodeJS foundation? (Currently owned by Samsung)
Joyent

### ~ 26:43 What does the NodeJS foundation do (what is its role?)
The foundation gives full autonomy over the project. The comapny specializes in application virtualization and cloud computing.

### ~ 34:00 Who is the guest and what is his job?
Mikeal Rogers. He is lately doing a lot of matrix and operational work.

### ~ 38:48 How much did Mikael reduce his code when he switched from Python to NodeJS?
The first thing Mikeal ever wrote on Node was an http proxy and it was 40 lines of code. So he reduced from this code from thousand lines of code to just 40.

### ~41:54 is it possible to run NodeJS for command line scripting?
Yes, it is possible. In fact there is a lot of features in npm that help you do this with something called npm scripts that install scripts that are commands, there is local commands to a project, local dependencies. 

### ~45:00 Where is pretty much every NPM module hosted?
GitHub

### ~47:40 What is the Go language good at and what is it not?
Not just backend services even command line utilities Go is incredibly popular in that particular area. But it does not run in a browser.

### ~50:55 Is there any relationship between NodeJS and Docker?
They both happen to work together. There is no such official relationship between them. Node foundation is part of the Linux foundation collaborative project.
