### ~3:28 When did Ken Thompson release his shell and what was it missing?

### ~7:59 Why was Brian Fox the perfect person to develop the Bash Shell?
To free people from Bourne Shell had to find a coder who had the ability to write a program that did everything a Bourne Shell could do but withou seeing the actual source code and Richard Stallman had the coder for job and that is Brain Fox.

### ~9:30 How long did it take to create the Bash shell and what was difficult about this?
It took 9 months to create the Bash Shell. The reason it was challenging was that they had to faithfully mimic all of the behaviours of the Bourne Shell while at the same time being allowed to make it a better tool for people to use. David Korn said to put every feature of Korn shell as standard features. Few features out of it were not compatible. So building a POSIX component shell that was 100 percent perfectly compatible with every single shell script that ever been written for the Bourne shell took longer than 3 months.

### ~20:46 Was Steven Bourne “cool” with the Bash Shell?
Yes. He says tghe relationship between Bash and original shell was just a reimplementation of the language and overtime it did have features added to it so bash did progress on what he wrote. He uses it all the time now. There is no bitterness at all.

### ~22:52 What prepares you to be more of a long-term thinker?
There is a value in learning scripting because that prepares you to be much more of a long term thinker when it comes to automation itself as you can see how a script runs so that makes you a different thinker a different technologist.
